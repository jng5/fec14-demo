This is responsitory of the demo code from the live coding session during my talk.

This demo newsletter is meant for demonstration and educational purposes only and is not extensively tested or meant for real use.

**TL;DR**  
See the [code changes required to make footer responsive](https://github.com/jng5/fec14-demo/commit/659c500f721b291e5ffa860bc95b2c1c8f61f0c7) for both Android 4.3 and Outlook

## File structure

Please note these folders also include code changes/demoes that were not shown during live coding session.

  * **original-not-responsive**  
    original source code
    
  * **responsive-v1**:  
    Initial responsive footer. Does not work for Android 4.3+ Email app.
    
  * **responsive-v2**:  
    Make footer responsive for Anroid 4.3 but still work for Outlook.
    
  * **responsive-final**:  
    Some more responsive changes to article content above, e.g. hide body text, use buttons.
  
#### Files

   * `build.html` - inlined HTML markup to be sent
   * `demo.html` and `styles.css` compiled email integrating dynamic content, but without prelined CSS. I find it helpful for debugging.
  
## Source Folder

  * `reset.css` - some generic resets you should include in every email.
  * `responsive.css` - the simple styles we used to make the footer responsive.
  * `index.html.erb` - **finished** ERB file used to create markup.
  * `original.html.erb` - original ERB file used to create markup. 
  
As you can imagine, I use a markup templating language like `ERB` or `twig` so I can make my markup changes in **one place instead of three** if I have 3 footer columns.
